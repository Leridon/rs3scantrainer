<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

Clue Trainer is a new clue solver for RuneScape 3 using the Alt1 Toolkit. 
Some Highlights:
- A more relaxed puzzle solver updating the move overlay in real time according to your actual solving speed and producing solutions with fewer steps.
- Real time overlay updating for celtic knots, lockboxes and tower puzzles as well.
- Movement instructions shown on the map, so you can learn the most efficient paths along the way.
- Advanced strategies for scan clues displayed in an interactive, easy to memorize fashion.
- A compass solver more accurate than ever with the ability to select preset triangulation strategies.
- A path and method editor so you can create, save, and share your own ways of solving clues.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Make sure you have the Alt1 toolkit installed. Alt1 can only be downloaded legitimately from [runeapps.org](https://runeapps.org/).
2. Visit the [Web Version](https://cluetrainer.app) to access some of Clue Trainer's features or install it using the links provided there.
3. Alternatively, open `alt1://addapp/https://cluetrainer.app/appconfig.json` in your browser or visit https://cluetrainer.app in Alt1's included browser.

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

### Development

This section is about getting started with developing Clue Trainer. See [here](#getting-started) for instructions for getting started with using Clue Trainer.

Clue Trainer is a static website built using npm and TypeScript. 

1. Install dependencies using npm.
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
2. Build the project into the `dist` folder
   ```sh
   npm run build
   ```
3. Serve the static content using a local webserver so it can be accessed in a browser or installed in Alt1. This is also available as a convenience in the script file `serve_for_alt1.sh`.
   ````sh
   cd dist
   python3 -m http.server 8000 --bind 127.0.0.1
   ````
4. Visit `127.0.0.1` in your browser to use your local version and install it in your local Alt1 

Please do not enable any crowdsourcing options while using your local development version.
